This file was created to display how the PL works.

Shell.py -
Our shell, mostly like a CLT like when you enter python command.

Basic.py -
Most of our language.

How shell works:
Prompts "cord > " and asks for a calculation, when prompted it will roll out with tokens of the calculation you just entered.

Why are we doing this all in just the lexer class? Can't we do it seperatly?
It helps us to make these bits easier for the interperter / compiler to process this code.

Next is Parsing, Parsing is when we lexer any type of code and make other software understand it or it's part of a compiling process.

Grammer.TXT is the file where some vocabulary you need to know to understand how we parse our PL.

Our PL for now is like a number token machine

We also have nodes which are basically like data types or data structures or even pointers for another node. You see nodes classes on ("./basic.py")

We're creating our PL in python and it's just classes with variables and functions and using them in other classes.

Contact me on discord to get this PL.

My discord details will probably be on github, so stay tuned. (https://github.com/raviolisgithub)
